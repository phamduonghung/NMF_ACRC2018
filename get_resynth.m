function srec = get_resynth(q,Nfft,H)
% Extracts a mode from the TF representation of a signal.
%
% INPUTS:
%   : Thresholded STFT of the signal
%   Offset_Freq: Number of negative frequency bins in S
%   Nfft/2: Number of total frequency bins in S
%   Nfft: total number of bins when computing the STFT (but most of the
%       negative frequencies where removed, since one only deals with real
%       signals)
%   H: window
%
% OUTPUTS
%   srec: reconstructed mode
